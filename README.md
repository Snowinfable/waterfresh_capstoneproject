# waterfresh_capstoneproject

This repository is related to the UMSI - MADS capstone project from Matthew Parent and Shiyi Song, analyzing the change in water levels in groundwater wells throughout the United States. The project analyzes current trends in groundwater-related issues facing the United States, and attempts to create a model the can predict future water level changes based a variety of water use and other environmental data.


### Below is a high level overview of the repository:
- project_code_data/ a folder containing datasets in csv and tsv format, as well as information on how to access other data via API calls. The 'Water Trends' folder contains water level change data in wells around the US, the 'Water Use' folder contains USGS water usage data for all US counties, then the 'access-climate-data.txt' and 'access-evapotranspiration-data.txt' files contain instructions/urls on how to access the climate and evapotranspiration data. 
- requirements.txt: the software package requirements for running the code in this repository
- README.md: this file that explains how to use the github repository
- Data Access Statement

### How to use this repository
To reproduce the results from the following code you will need to download some data and run the notebooks in the project_code_data folder in a specific order.
