# waterfresh_capstoneproject

This repository is related to the UMSI - MADS capstone project from Matthew Parent and Shiyi Song, analyzing the change in water levels in groundwater wells throughout the United States. The project analyzes current trends in groundwater-related issues facing the United States, and attempts to create a model the can predict future water level changes based a variety of water use and other environmental data.


Below is a high level overview of the repository:
- data/ a folder containing datasets in csv and tsv format, as well as information on how to access other data via API calls. The 'Water Trends' folder contains water level change data in wells around the US, the 'Water Use' folder contains USGS water usage data for all US counties, then the 'access-climate-data.txt' and 'access-evapotranspiration-data.txt' files contain instructions/urls on how to access the climate and evapotranspiration data. 
- Data cleaning/ a folder containing jupyter notebooks for cleaning and manipulating all of the datasets used in our models. 
- Modeling/ a folder containing jupyter notebooks for constructing models that predict water level changes in wells. 
- Visualizations/ a folder containing jupyter notebooks for construction of the visuzalizations found in the project report
- LICENSE: a license stating the allowed use of the elements of this repository
- requirements.txt: the software package requirements for running the code in this repository
